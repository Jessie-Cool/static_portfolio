          I'm a programmer. I mostly do web development for my work, but I'm interested in all sorts of aspects of the
          field. Outside of my web dev work I've been really interested in software defined radios and Rust!

          Through my work I've gained experience with all sorts of modern frontend frameworks, and been involved pretty
          heavily with JavaScript and Java backends. I'm strongest on the frontend but I can confidently work
          full-stack! In fact I prefer working full stack!

          When I have some free time I try to play at being a musician. I'm mostly a guitar player, but I've been
          learning
          how to do production work as well. In terms of what I listen to it's all over the place, but I'm really into
          twinkly guitars with harsh vocals.
